# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

**Development setup (resets database, imports avatars, starts server):**
```bash
./migrate.sh
```

**Run dev server only (after migrate.sh has been run):**
```bash
export DEBUG=1
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Create and apply migrations:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations intern --name <migration_name>
python manage.py migrate
```

**Production start (inside Docker):**
```bash
./start.sh  # Resets DB, collects static, starts nginx + gunicorn
```

**Build and run Docker container:**
```bash
docker build -t cantoreub .
docker run -p 8000:8000 cantoreub
```

## Architecture

CantorHub is a Django 6 member portal for "Just Gospel Frankfurt", a gospel choir. All application logic lives in the single `intern/` app; `config/` holds only settings and URL routing.

### Request flow

```
Browser → nginx (port 8000) → gunicorn (port 8001) → Django
```

Nginx serves `/static/` and `/media/` directly; everything else is proxied to gunicorn. In development, `manage.py runserver` handles everything.

### URL structure

- `/` — public homepage (`templates/index.html`)
- `/admin/` — Django admin
- `/intern/*` — all authenticated views (`intern/urls.py`)

### Key models (`intern/models.py`)

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `User` | Extended `AbstractUser` — adds voice type, address, XMPP, coordinates |
| `Artikel` | Versioned articles/news items |
| `Forum` / `Mitteilung` | Discussion threads and messages |
| `Termin` / `Ort` | Events and locations |
| `Lied` | Songs in the repertoire |
| `Konzert` | Ordered song list for a specific event (links `Lied` ↔ `Termin`) |
| `Zusage` | Per-member attendance response to an event |
| `Abstimmung` | Voting records |
| `TabellenPreferenzen` | Per-user table column visibility preferences |

### File management

Uses `django-filer`. Folder IDs are hard-coded constants in `settings.py` (e.g. `FOLDER_AVATARE = 1`, `FOLDER_MUSIK = 5`). The `import_files` management command imports avatars from the `Avatare/` directory into filer on first setup.

### Notable utilities (`intern/`)

- `replacements.py` — wiki-like markup processor (lists, code blocks, `[[Datei:...]]` file links)
- `php_pbkdf2_hasher.py` — legacy password hasher for migrating users from a prior PHP system; listed in `PASSWORD_HASHERS` in settings
- `fuzzy.py` — fuzzy song title matching used in article references
- `context_processors.py` — injects global template context

### Migration quirks

`migrate.sh` / `start.sh` delete `intern/migrations/0002_add_filer.py` and temporarily move `0003_import.py` out before regenerating migrations. This is intentional — `0002` is always regenerated fresh and `0003` depends on it being newly created. Do not check `0002_add_filer.py` into git.

### Database

SQLite in development (`db.sqlite3`, excluded from git). MySQL-compatible for production via `pymysql`.

### Environment variables

- `DEBUG` — set to `1` for development mode
- `SECRET_KEY` — hardcoded in `settings.py` (development only; override for production)
